      <p>Here I find myself in Hartford, Connecticut on a lovely Friday afternoon visiting the home of Mark Twain. 
        His billards room was fantastic and I wished I could have played a game with the legendary author. 
        I could definitely see him in the room with friends enjoying the autumn weather.</p>
